# GAME-LAB server

But github.com/hackclub/game-lab is a static page? Why does it need a server??2?

GAME-LAB is very much in beta.  We expect GAME-LAB to change while working on it and iterating on it to make it the best it can be.

All that said, we want to make sure you can still play your old games & programs built in GAME-LAB, so this server handles loading previous versions of the editor and engine.

## How does it work?

When a user goes to `game-lab.hackclub.com?id=md5abc` to load a cartridge, their page checks if it has a different editor version running.
